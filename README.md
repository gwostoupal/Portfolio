<h3>About Me</h3>
  
<h5>Hello everyone, I'm a second-year PhD student in the Industrial-Organizational Psychology program at Seattle Pacific University. My general research interest is personnel selection. My specific interests in the field are asessement methods, individual differences, applicant perceptions, and emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and social media. Currently, I serve as the lead graduate research assistant on a qualitative study examining the challenges that prompt Christian middle managers to draw on their faith at work. I am also part of the SIOP Strategic Taskforce where we analyze qualitative and quantitative membership data to inform SIOP’s future 3–5-year strategic plan. I am eager to delve more into my passion of personnel selection through research and applied opportunities!<h5>
